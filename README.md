Step by step instructions:
Look for a starting point
![one](https://github.com/21david/Trip-Cost-Calculator/blob/master/images/Step%201.png)

Look for a destination point
![two](https://github.com/21david/Trip-Cost-Calculator/blob/master/images/Step%202.png)

After clicking on the destination point, you should see the best route from the starting point to the destination point
![three](https://github.com/21david/Trip-Cost-Calculator/blob/master/images/Step%203.png)

Now copy and paste these locations into their corresponding textboxes above.
(SHORTCUT: Ctrl + A to select all, then simply drag the highlighted text into the textbox.)
![four](https://github.com/21david/Trip-Cost-Calculator/blob/master/images/Step%204.png)

Fill in the last two textboxes with a price of gasoline and a car's fuel consumption.
(You can find current gas prices from a quick google search: https://bit.ly/2BE6Vvc )
(Note: a typical fuel consumption value is 15-20 mpg for local driving, such as driving within a city, and 30 mpg for long distance driving, such as driving from one city to another. Use these values if you do not know your car's fuel consumption value.)
![five](https://github.com/21david/Trip-Cost-Calculator/blob/master/images/Step%205.png)

Press the "Calculate cost" button at the bottom of the screen, and viola! You will receive a close approximate value of driving from your starting point to your destination point, as well as the distance and the gallons you would use.

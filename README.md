## Step by step instructions
### 1) Look for a starting point

### 2) Look for a destination point

### 3) After clicking on the destination point, you should see the best route from the starting point to the destination point

### 4) Now copy and paste these locations into their corresponding textboxes above.

(SHORTCUT: Ctrl + A to select text, then simply drag the highlighted text into the textbox.)

### 5) Fill in the last two textboxes with a price of gasoline and a car's fuel consumption.

(You can find current gas prices from a quick google search: https://bit.ly/2BE6Vvc )

(Note: a typical fuel consumption value is 15-20 mpg for local driving, such as driving within a city, and 30 mpg for long distance driving, such as driving from one city to another. Use these values if you don't know your car's fuel consumption value.)

### 6) Press the "Calculate cost" button at the bottom of the screen, and viola! You will receive a close approximation of the cost of driving from your starting point to your destination point, as well as the distance you would travel and the gallons you would use.
